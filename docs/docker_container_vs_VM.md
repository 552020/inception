# Docker Containers vs. Virtual Machines and the `tail -f` Trick

## Docker Container vs. Virtual Machine

Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs) are both technologies used for isolating applications, but they differ significantly in how they operate and manage resources.

| **Aspect**          | **Docker Container**                          | **Virtual Machine (VM)**                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**    | Shares host OS kernel, isolates processes     | Full OS with virtual hardware              |
| **Resource Usage**  | Lightweight, minimal resource consumption     | Heavy, requires more CPU, memory, and disk |
| **Startup Speed**   | Fast, starts in seconds                       | Slow, can take minutes to boot             |
| **Isolation Level** | Process-level isolation                       | Full OS-level isolation                    |
| **Best Use Case**   | Running a single service or microservice      | Running multiple services or full OS tasks |
| **Portability**     | Highly portable across environments           | Less portable due to OS dependencies       |
| **Efficiency**      | More efficient for scaling and resource usage | Less efficient, consumes more resources    |
| **Example**         | Running NGINX or MySQL in a container         | Running an entire Linux or Windows system  |

### Key Differences:

- **Resource Efficiency:** Docker containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, whereas VMs include their own OS and virtualized hardware, making them heavier and slower.
- **Isolation Level:** Containers isolate applications at the process level, while VMs isolate entire operating systems.
- **Startup Speed:** Containers start up much faster (in seconds) compared to VMs, which can take minutes due to the need to boot the entire OS.
- **Best Use Case:** Containers are ideal for running microservices or individual applications, whereas VMs are better suited for situations where full OS-level isolation is needed.

## The `tail -f` Trick in Docker

### What is `tail -f`?

`tail -f` is a command that allows you to continuously monitor the end of a file in real time. It’s commonly used for watching log files grow as new entries are added.

#### Example Use:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

- **Purpose:** This command lets you see new log entries as they are written to the `access.log` file for NGINX.

### Why the `tail -f` Trick is Misused in Docker

Some people try to use `tail -f` in Docker containers to keep them running when the main service (such as NGINX or MySQL) exits or runs in the background (daemon mode). For example, they might use `tail -f /dev/null` to keep the container alive by following an empty file.

#### Problem with This Approach:

1. **Waste of Resources:** Running `tail -f` on an empty file (`/dev/null`) consumes resources and keeps the container alive for no valid reason.
2. **Poor Design:** Containers should run a single, meaningful process (like a web server or database). Using `tail -f` to keep them alive artificially violates Docker’s design principles.
3. **Maintenance Issues:** It complicates troubleshooting because the container isn’t kept alive by the service it’s supposed to run, but by a dummy process like `tail -f`.

### Example: Improper Use of `tail -f` to Keep a Container Alive

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

# NGINX runs as a background (daemon) process, but 'tail -f' is used to keep the container alive
CMD ["nginx", "&&", "tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

- **What Happens:** NGINX runs in the background (as a daemon), and `tail -f` follows `/dev/null` to keep the container running.
- **Why It’s Wrong:** This container is being kept alive by `tail -f`, not by the actual NGINX process, which is a hack and poor practice.

---

## Proper Docker Container Setup: Running the Main Process in the Foreground

Instead of using `tail -f`, the proper way to keep a container running is to ensure that the main service (like NGINX) runs in the foreground. This allows Docker to manage the container's lifecycle based on the actual process it’s supposed to run.

### Correct Example: NGINX Running in the Foreground

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

# NGINX will run in the foreground (not as a daemon)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- **What Happens:** The command `nginx -g "daemon off;"` tells NGINX to run in the foreground. Docker will keep the container alive as long as NGINX is running.
- **Why It’s Correct:** This method allows NGINX to be the main process (PID 1), and Docker manages the container properly based on the lifecycle of the NGINX service.

---

## Example Comparison: Proper and Improper Dockerfile Configurations

### 1. **NGINX Container That Stops (NGINX in Background)**

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

# NGINX runs in the background (daemon mode)
CMD ["nginx"]
```

- **Result:** The container will stop because NGINX runs in the background, and Docker thinks the container’s task is complete.

---

### 2. **NGINX Container Kept Alive with `tail -f` (Incorrect)**

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

# NGINX runs in the background, but 'tail -f' keeps the container alive artificially
CMD ["nginx", "&&", "tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

- **Result:** The container stays alive, but for the wrong reason: `tail -f` is used to keep the container running artificially, which is bad practice.

---

### 3. **Correct NGINX Container (NGINX in the Foreground)**

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

# NGINX runs in the foreground (not as a daemon)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- **Result:** The container stays alive because NGINX is running in the foreground. Docker manages the container lifecycle properly based on the service's state.

---

## Conclusion

Using `tail -f` to keep Docker containers alive is a common but flawed workaround. The correct approach is to ensure that the main service or process (such as NGINX) runs in the foreground, allowing Docker to properly manage the container. This results in cleaner, more efficient, and easier-to-maintain containers that behave as intended without unnecessary hacks.

Certainly! Here's a paragraph explaining why we need `daemon off` in NGINX but not in MariaDB:

Certainly! Let's analyze this Dockerfile and the accompanying `wordpress_setup.sh` script, and I'll also add some explanation lines to the preceding paragraph about why we need `daemon off` in NGINX but not in MariaDB or PHP-FPM.

### Why Do We Need `daemon off` in NGINX but Not in PHP-FPM or MariaDB?

**NGINX:**

- **Daemon Behavior:** By default, NGINX runs as a daemon (i.e., in the background). In Docker, a container expects the main process (PID 1) to remain in the foreground to keep the container alive. If NGINX is allowed to daemonize, Docker will think the process has finished and will stop the container.
- **`daemon off;` Directive:** To prevent NGINX from daemonizing, we use the `daemon off;` directive, which forces NGINX to stay in the foreground. This ensures that NGINX is the primary process keeping the container alive, as Docker monitors it.

**MariaDB:**

- **Foreground Process by Default:** In contrast, MariaDB (when started with `mysqld_safe`) runs in the foreground by default. The `mysqld_safe` script is designed to manage the MariaDB server, and it does not daemonize unless explicitly configured to do so. This means that MariaDB behaves correctly in a Docker container without needing a `daemon off` directive. Docker will monitor `mysqld_safe` as the main process (PID 1) and keep the container running while MariaDB is active.

**PHP-FPM:**

- **`-F` Flag:** Similarly, PHP-FPM can run as a daemon by default, but when we use the `-F` flag (as seen in this `wordpress_setup.sh` script), it forces PHP-FPM to run in the foreground. This is crucial in Docker containers because Docker needs a foreground process to keep the container alive. By running PHP-FPM with the `-F` flag, PHP-FPM becomes the main process that Docker monitors, and no `daemon off` equivalent is required here either.

---

### Conclusion

In summary, **NGINX** requires the `daemon off;` directive because it daemonizes by default and needs to run in the foreground to keep the Docker container alive. On the other hand, **MariaDB** and **PHP-FPM** can be configured to run in the foreground using their respective flags (`mysqld_safe` for MariaDB and `-F` for PHP-FPM), making them suitable for Docker containers without needing any additional "daemon off" configuration.

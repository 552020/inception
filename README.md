# Inception as a real world project

This repo is about making inception a real world project.

## Digital Ocean VM

We picked up a Digital Ocean droplet to have a VM in the cloud, but you could use any other service.

Is it possible to do it also locally? The problem is that you normally don't have a public IP address on your local machine.

It's not necessary but recommanded to have SSH access to your droplet, so that you can control it from your local machine. The alternative would be to work on the console of the web interface of the provider (digial Ocean)

## Install docker in the VM
